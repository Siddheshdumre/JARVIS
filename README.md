## Introduction

JARVIS (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) is inspired by the AI assistant from the Iron Man movies. This assistant listens to your voice commands, processes them, and executes tasks like fetching information from the web, controlling system functions, and more.

## Features

- Voice command recognition and response.
- Fetches real-time information like weather, news, etc.
- Controls system functions (e.g., opening applications).
- Sets reminders and alarms.
- Provides answers to factual questions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **SpeechRecognition**: For recognizing spoken commands.
- **Pyttsx3**: For text-to-speech functionality.
- **Wolfram Alpha API**: For answering factual questions.
- **Web Scraping Libraries**: For fetching data from the web (if applicable).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Siddheshdumre/JARVIS.git
   cd JARVIS
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure your API keys in the `config.py` file for services like Wolfram Alpha (if used).

## Usage

1. Start the application by running:
   ```bash
   python jarvis.py
   ```
2. Give voice commands like "What's the weather?" or "Open Notepad."

## Future Improvements

- Add support for additional APIs (e.g., Google Calendar, Spotify).
- Integrate with IoT devices for smart home control.
- Improve NLP capabilities for better understanding of commands.
